#Read me file for the Structure Analysis part of this project.
###This file will walk you through all files contained within this folder. Please see the readme for those folders.

1. All4\_Proc.pdf - output from Structure\_figures\_proc. Contains all 4 figures generated to compare original, K = 2, k = 3, and k = 4
2.Comp\_5\_7\_admixture.pdf - figure that compares the barplot for k = 5 and k = 7 admixture results. See Structure\_Figures documentation
3. full\_pc.txt - output from Structure\_workflow. Contains the first 3 PCs for the full SNP data set. See Structure_workflow for more information
4. PC\_Comp\_both.pdf - output from structure_figures and compares the colored PCA plot from k = 5 and k = 7 results. See structure\_figures documentation
5. PC\_Comp\-Subpop5.pdf - output from structure_figures and compares the original full pca figure and PCA plot from k = 5 results. See structure\_figures documentation
6. PC\_Comp\-Subpop7.pdf - output from structure_figures and compares the original full pca figure and PCA plot from k = 7 results. See structure\_figures documentation
7.Proc\_PC.txt - processing genotypes SNP dataset and the first 3 PCS. See Structure\_workflow for more information 
8. Proc\_PC\_Comp\-Subpop2.pdf - output from structure\_figures\Proc and compares the original processing pca figure and PCA plot from k = 2 results. See structure\_figures\_Proc documentation  
9. Proc\_PC\_Comp\-Subpop3.pdf - output from structure\_figures\Proc and compares the original processing pca figure and PCA plot from k = 3 results. See structure\_figures\_Proc documentation
10. Proc\_PC\_Comp\-Subpop4.pdf - output from structure\_figures\Proc and compares the original processing pca figure and PCA plot from k = 4 results. See structure\_figures\_Proc documentation
11. Structure\_Figures (.HTML and .rmd) - workflow for creating and analyzing the structure output files and creating the figures on the full SNP dataset
12. Structure\_Figures\_Proc (.HTML and .rmd) - workflow for creating and analyzing the structure output files and creating the figures on the processing SNP dataset
13. tomato.5 and tomato.7 (.F and .Q) - these are the output files files from admixture software that was done on the full SNP dataset
14. tomato\_proc.2, tomato\_proc.3, tomato\_proc.4 - these are the output files from admixture software that was done on the processing SNP dataset
15. tomato_sampID_info and tomato_sampID_proc_info (.txt) - these are the genotype information files for the full and processing SNP datasets. When running through admixture, you can't take in the genotype information, so these are the corresponding files from that analysis.
